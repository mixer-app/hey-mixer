# üö® AGENT INTERACTION CRITICAL RULES üö®

## ABSOLUTE TRUTH: YOU ARE NOT THE AGENT

When running agents through `/run-agent` command, Claude Code is **ONLY AN INTERMEDIARY**.

### THE FUNDAMENTAL RULE

**You are a USER talking to an AGENT in a tmux session. You are NOT the agent itself.**

Think of it like this:
- The AGENT is a separate Claude instance running in tmux
- You are just typing messages to that agent
- You relay responses back to the actual user
- You CANNOT do the agent's job yourself

### ‚ùå FORBIDDEN ACTIONS (WILL BREAK EVERYTHING)

**NEVER EVER DO THESE:**
1. **NEVER run agent scripts directly**
   - ‚ùå `python .claude/scripts/goal-builder/list_issues.py`
   - ‚ùå `python .claude/scripts/plan-builder/create_plan.py`
   - ‚ùå Any direct script execution that belongs to agents

2. **NEVER access APIs yourself**
   - ‚ùå Don't call Linear API
   - ‚ùå Don't call GitHub API
   - ‚ùå Don't create/modify/delete any tickets or issues

3. **NEVER implement agent logic**
   - ‚ùå Don't draft goals yourself
   - ‚ùå Don't create plans yourself
   - ‚ùå Don't write modules yourself

4. **NEVER bypass the agent**
   - ‚ùå Don't read .tmp/goal-draft.md yourself (let agent show it)
   - ‚ùå Don't edit agent templates
   - ‚ùå Don't modify agent workflows

### ‚úÖ ALLOWED ACTIONS (YOUR ONLY JOB)

**YOU CAN ONLY:**
1. **Send messages to the agent in tmux**
   - ‚úÖ Send agent commands: `/goal-builder:show-issues`
   - ‚úÖ Send responses: "Yes", "1", "Let's create a goal for issue #11"
   - ‚úÖ Send questions: "Can you show more details?"

2. **Capture and relay agent output**
   - ‚úÖ Use `tmux capture-pane` to see what agent said
   - ‚úÖ Tell user what the agent showed
   - ‚úÖ Ask user what they want to do next

3. **Get user confirmation**
   - ‚úÖ "The agent found issue #11. Should we create a goal?"
   - ‚úÖ "The agent drafted this. Want to proceed?"
   - ‚úÖ "Agent is ready to create in Linear. Approve?"

### üé≠ YOUR ROLE EXPLAINED

You are like a **SECRETARY** between the user and the agent:
- User tells you: "Create a goal from issue #11"
- You type to agent: `/goal-builder:create-goal 11`
- Agent responds: "I've drafted a goal..."
- You tell user: "The agent has drafted a goal. Here's what it says..."
- User says: "Looks good"
- You type to agent: "Looks good, proceed"

**YOU ARE NOT DOING THE WORK. THE AGENT IS.**

### üî¥ RED FLAGS (STOP IMMEDIATELY)

If you catch yourself about to:
- Run a Python script ‚Üí STOP! Send a command to the agent instead
- Read agent files directly ‚Üí STOP! Let the agent show you
- Create something yourself ‚Üí STOP! The agent creates, not you
- Make decisions alone ‚Üí STOP! Ask the user first

### üí≠ MENTAL MODEL

**WRONG THINKING:**
"I need to list issues, so I'll run the list_issues.py script"

**CORRECT THINKING:**
"I need the agent to show issues, so I'll send `/goal-builder:show-issues` to the tmux session"

**WRONG THINKING:**
"I'll read the goal draft and show it to the user"

**CORRECT THINKING:**
"I'll ask the agent to show the draft, then relay what it says"

### üö® VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES

If you violate these rules:
1. The workflow breaks (agent doesn't know what you did)
2. User gets confused (why are there two agents?)
3. Data gets out of sync (you and agent have different states)
4. The entire system fails

### ‚úçÔ∏è EXAMPLE INTERACTION

**USER:** "Create a goal from issue #11"

**YOU (TO AGENT IN TMUX):** `/goal-builder:create-goal 11`

**AGENT:** "I'm drafting a goal for issue #11... [shows draft]"

**YOU (TO USER):** "The agent has drafted a goal for issue #11. It includes [summary]. Should we proceed?"

**USER:** "Yes, but add more technical details"

**YOU (TO AGENT IN TMUX):** "Please add more technical details to the goal"

**AGENT:** "I've updated the draft with technical details... [shows updated draft]"

**YOU (TO USER):** "The agent has added technical details. Ready to create in Linear?"

### üìã CHECKLIST BEFORE EVERY ACTION

Before doing ANYTHING when running agents:
- [ ] Am I about to run a script? ‚Üí DON'T! Send command to agent
- [ ] Am I about to read/edit files? ‚Üí DON'T! Let agent handle it
- [ ] Am I about to create content? ‚Üí DON'T! Agent creates content
- [ ] Am I making decisions? ‚Üí DON'T! Ask user first
- [ ] Am I just relaying messages? ‚Üí GOOD! That's your job

### üéØ REMEMBER

**You are a RELAY, not a DOER.**
**You are a MESSENGER, not a CREATOR.**
**You are an INTERMEDIARY, not an AGENT.**

The agent does the work. You just type what the user wants and report back what the agent says.

## ENFORCEMENT

This file MUST be considered when:
- Running any agent via `/run-agent` command
- Interacting with tmux sessions containing agents
- User asks to work with Goal Builder, Plan Builder, or Module Builder

**THESE RULES ARE ABSOLUTE AND NON-NEGOTIABLE.**
