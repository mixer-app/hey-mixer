# Create Goal Ticket

Work with the user to create a Linear goal ticket from GitHub issues.

## üö® CRITICAL RULE - NEVER SHOW DRAFTS IN CHAT üö®

**THIS IS THE #1 RULE: You MUST write drafts DIRECTLY to file WITHOUT showing them in chat first!**

### ‚ùå WRONG WAY (NEVER DO THIS):
1. ‚ùå Draft content in your response
2. ‚ùå Show the draft to the user in chat
3. ‚ùå Ask "What do you think of this draft?"
4. ‚ùå Then save it to a file

### ‚úÖ CORRECT WAY (ALWAYS DO THIS):
1. ‚úÖ Think about the content internally
2. ‚úÖ IMMEDIATELY use Write tool to save to `.tmp/goal-draft.md`
3. ‚úÖ Use Read tool to show the file to user
4. ‚úÖ Use Edit tool to refine based on feedback
5. ‚úÖ Only create in Linear after explicit approval

**If you show a draft in chat before writing to file, you have FAILED this workflow!**

## Process

This is an INTERACTIVE process where you WRITE THE TICKET CONTENT WITH THE USER.

### 1. Load GitHub Issues

First, get the list of open issues:

```bash
python .claude/scripts/goal-builder/list_issues.py
```

### 1.5 Load Full Issue Content (if issue number provided as argument)

**IMPORTANT**: If an issue number was provided as an argument to this command (e.g., `/goal-builder:create-goal 11`), you MUST load the full issue content before drafting:

```bash
python .claude/scripts/goal-builder/load_issue.py --issue-number 11
```

This displays the **FULL issue body** (not just the 200-char preview). You need this complete context to draft a comprehensive goal ticket that accurately captures all the requirements from the GitHub issue.

**Why this is critical:**
- `list_issues.py` only shows 200-char previews for discovery
- The full issue body contains all the detailed requirements
- Without loading the full content, you're drafting from incomplete information

### 2. CONTINUOUSLY Write and Update Draft File During Discussion

**FROM THE VERY FIRST MESSAGE: Start writing to `.tmp/goal-draft.md` IMMEDIATELY!**

- As SOON as you start discussing, create the draft file
- EVERY time you discuss a new idea, update the file
- CONTINUOUSLY save progress to the file throughout the conversation
- The file should ALWAYS reflect the current state of the discussion
- Include sections like:
  - Description (what needs to be built)
  - Requirements
  - Success Criteria
  - Target (e.g., `modules/auth/`)
  - Related GitHub Issues

**The draft file is your LIVE WORKING DOCUMENT - update it constantly!**
- Don't wait until "the end" to create the file
- Don't accumulate ideas then write - write AS you discuss
- User should be able to check `.tmp/goal-draft.md` at ANY point and see current progress

### 3. File Operations During Discussion

**IMPORTANT**: WRITE the draft DIRECTLY to a file in the PROJECT'S temp folder BEFORE asking for approval:

```bash
# Create project temp directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p .tmp
```

Then use the **Write tool** to create the file:
```
Write(.tmp/goal-draft.md) with the complete draft content
```

**DO NOT**:
- Show draft in chat then save it
- Use cat or echo commands
- Copy/paste content to file

**DO**:
- Write directly to `.tmp/goal-draft.md` using the Write tool
- Show the file after writing it
- Edit the file based on feedback

### 4. Iterative Refinement Process

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW**:
1. Show the saved draft to the user
2. Ask: "Would you like to make any changes to this draft?"
3. If user provides feedback:
   - Edit the file directly using Edit tool
   - Show the updated version
   - Ask for feedback again
4. Continue until user explicitly says: "approved", "looks good", "create it", or similar
5. DO NOT proceed to Linear until user gives final approval

Example interaction:
- User: "Add more detail about error handling"
- You: Edit `.tmp/goal-draft.md` to add error handling details
- User: "Change the module name to mixer-assistant"
- You: Edit `.tmp/goal-draft.md` to update module name
- User: "Perfect, create it"
- You: NOW proceed to create in Linear

### 5. Create Ticket with Exact Draft Content (ONLY AFTER APPROVAL)

**ONLY proceed when user explicitly approves (says "approved", "create it", "looks good", etc.)**

```bash
# Create the Linear goal ticket with the draft content
python .claude/scripts/goal-builder/create_goal_from_draft.py \
  --draft-file ".tmp/goal-draft.md" \
  --issues "12,15,18" \
  --status "draft"
```

### 6. Close GitHub Issues

After successfully creating the goal:

```bash
# Close the GitHub issues that were included
python .claude/scripts/goal-builder/close_issues.py --issues "12,15,18"
```

### 7. Explain Next Steps

Tell the user:
- The goal is now in "draft" status
- They should review it in Linear
- When ready, change status to "todo" for Plan Builder

## Important

- ALWAYS create with status="draft"
- Get user approval before creating
- The ticket contains EXACTLY what you wrote together
- Close GitHub issues after creating goal
- Explain the draft‚Üítodo transition
