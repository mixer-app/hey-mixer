# Save Goal Draft

Save the current goal draft to a file for review before creating in Linear.

## Instructions

Save the agreed-upon goal content to a temporary file:

```bash
# Default location
cat > /tmp/goal-draft.md << 'EOF'
[INSERT THE EXACT APPROVED GOAL CONTENT HERE]
EOF

# Or to a specific file if provided
cat > /tmp/$ARGUMENTS-draft.md << 'EOF'
[INSERT THE EXACT APPROVED GOAL CONTENT HERE]
EOF
```

After saving:
1. Confirm the file was saved successfully
2. Tell the user where the draft was saved
3. Remind them they can review/edit before creating in Linear
4. Ask if they're ready to create the goal ticket

## Output Format

```
âœ… Draft saved successfully to: /tmp/goal-draft.md

You can review or edit the draft before creating the Linear ticket.
When you're ready, I'll create the goal with this exact content.
