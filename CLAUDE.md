# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## System Overview

The Mixer System is a conversational AI workflow for transforming ideas into code through structured project management. It uses three specialized Claude agents to process GitHub Issues ‚Üí Linear Goal Tickets ‚Üí Linear Plan Tickets ‚Üí Code Modules.

## üî¥ CRITICAL: AGENT INTERACTION RULES üî¥

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ABSOLUTE RULE #1: You Are NOT The Agent! ‚ö†Ô∏è
**MANDATORY: When running agents via tmux, you are ONLY a relay/intermediary!**
- **READ IMMEDIATELY:** `.claude/AGENT-INTERACTION-CRITICAL-RULES.md`
- **YOU CANNOT:** Run agent scripts directly (`python .claude/scripts/...`)
- **YOU CANNOT:** Access Linear/GitHub APIs yourself
- **YOU CAN ONLY:** Send messages to agent in tmux and relay responses

### When Coordinating with Agents via tmux:
**YOU MUST ALWAYS TRANSLATE USER INTENT INTO SLASH COMMANDS, NOT GENERIC TEXT!**

When running agents through tmux sessions, you are REQUIRED to:
1. **NEVER run agent scripts yourself** - The agent runs them, not you!
2. **ALWAYS translate user intent into slash commands** for any action that has a command
3. **NEVER send generic text** like "show issues" when `/goal-builder:show-issues` exists
4. **TRANSLATE option letters (A/B/C)** into the actual commands they represent
5. **VERIFY commands are executed** by checking for expected outputs (e.g., `.tmp/goal-draft.md`)

### Command Translation Examples (MANDATORY):
- User wants to see issues ‚Üí Send `/goal-builder:show-issues` NOT "show me issues"
- User wants to see draft goals ‚Üí Send `/goal-builder:show-drafts` NOT "show drafts"
- User wants to create a goal ‚Üí Send `/goal-builder:create-goal [numbers]` NOT "create a goal"
- User wants to edit a draft ‚Üí Send `/goal-builder:edit-draft [goal-id]` NOT "edit the draft"
- User wants to analyze ‚Üí Send `/goal-builder:analyze-issues` NOT "analyze the issues"
- **User says "A" (meaning create goal)** ‚Üí Send `/goal-builder:create-goal 11` NOT "A"
- **User says "B" (meaning read issue)** ‚Üí Send appropriate command NOT "B"

### Critical Translation Rule:
When the agent presents options like:
```
A) Create a goal ticket
B) Read the full issue first
C) Create more specific issues
```

And user responds with "A", you MUST:
1. Recognize "A" means "Create a goal ticket"
2. Translate this into the actual slash command: `/goal-builder:create-goal 11`
3. Send that command to the agent
4. NEVER just relay the letter "A"

### Verification Checklist:
- [ ] Did I use the exact slash command instead of generic text?
- [ ] Did the agent create expected files (e.g., `.tmp/goal-draft.md`)?
- [ ] Did the agent follow its documented workflow?

**FAILURE TO USE COMMANDS = CRITICAL WORKFLOW VIOLATION**

## Running Agents

```bash
# Start an agent (runs Claude CLI with agent-specific system prompt)
./mixer.sh goal-builder    # Transform GitHub issues into Linear goals
./mixer.sh plan-builder    # Break goals into implementation plans
./mixer.sh module-builder  # Execute plans to build feature modules
```

## Key Commands Available in Agents

### Goal Builder
- `/goal-builder:show-issues` - Display open GitHub issues
- `/goal-builder:show-drafts` - Display draft Linear goal tickets
- `/goal-builder:create-goal` - Interactively create goal ticket from issues
- `/goal-builder:edit-draft` - Edit an existing draft goal ticket

### Plan Builder
- `/plan-builder:show-goals` - Display Linear goals with status="todo"
- `/plan-builder:analyze-goal` - Analyze goal and suggest approach
- `/plan-builder:create-plan` - Interactively create plan from goal

### Module Builder
- `/module-builder:show-plans` - Display Linear plans with status="todo"
- `/module-builder:load-plan` - Load plan and start implementation
- `/module-builder:mark-complete` - Mark plan and parent goal as done

## Architecture

The system consists of three layers:

1. **Agent Layer** (`agents/*/`)
   - Each agent has a `system-prompt.md` defining its personality and workflow
   - `run.sh` launches Claude CLI with the prompt

2. **Command Layer** (`.claude/commands/*/`)
   - Markdown files defining slash commands
   - Commands guide conversational workflows, not just run scripts

3. **Script Layer** (`.claude/scripts/*/`)
   - Python scripts that interact with GitHub and Linear APIs
   - Shared utilities in `.claude/scripts/shared/`:
     - `github_client.py` - GitHub API wrapper
     - `linear_client.py` - Linear GraphQL client
     - `config_loader.py` - Loads config.yaml
     - `env_loader.py` - Loads .env file
     - `logger.py` - Logging utility

## Critical Workflow Rules

### Status Progression
- Goals/Plans are created with status="draft"
- User manually changes draft‚Üítodo when ready
- Agents automatically handle todo‚Üídoing‚Üídone transitions

### Interactive Ticket Writing
Agents must write ticket content WITH users through conversation:
1. Draft meaningful content (not templates)
2. Show draft to user
3. Refine based on feedback
4. Save EXACT agreed content to Linear

### Relationship Management
- Multiple GitHub issues ‚Üí One goal ticket
- Goal automatically updates to "doing" when plan created
- Plan and goal both update to "done" when module complete

## Configuration

### config.yaml
- `github.repo` - Repository for issues (e.g., "owner/repo")
- `linear.workspace` - Linear workspace name
- `linear.team_id` - Linear team identifier
- `linear.tickets.goal_label` - Label for goals (default: "goal")
- `linear.tickets.plan_label` - Label for plans (default: "plan")

### Environment (.env)
```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...      # GitHub personal access token
LINEAR_API_KEY=lin_api_... # Linear API key
```

## Module Development

Modules represent features and are organized in `modules/` directory:
- Each module is a self-contained feature
- Modules can be categorized (auth, api, ui, data, utils)
- Module Builder creates structure based on plan specifications

## Testing Scripts

```bash
# Test environment setup
./test-setup.sh  # Validates configuration and environment

# Test individual scripts
python .claude/scripts/goal-builder/list_issues.py
python .claude/scripts/plan-builder/list_goals.py
python .claude/scripts/module-builder/list_plans.py
```

## Important Implementation Notes

### When Creating/Modifying Commands
Commands in `.claude/commands/*/` should:
- Guide conversational workflows
- Include explicit approval steps
- Save draft content to temp files before creating tickets
- Use the `create_*_from_draft.py` scripts to preserve exact content

### When Working with Scripts
Python scripts in `.claude/scripts/*/`:
- Must import shared utilities using: `sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent))`
- Should use the shared clients (GitHubClient, LinearClient) for API calls
- Must respect status rules (only process "todo" items, create as "draft")

### Linear API Integration
The LinearClient uses GraphQL with these key operations:
- Create issues with labels and status
- Update issue status following workflow rules
- Link child issues to parent (plan‚Üígoal relationship)
- Query issues by label and status combination

### GitHub Integration
GitHubClient operations:
- `get_open_issues()` - Fetch all open issues
- `close_issue(number, comment)` - Close with explanation
- Issues serve as "stash" for raw ideas
